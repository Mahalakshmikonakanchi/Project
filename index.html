		<h1>YUMMY FOODS BLOG</h1>
		<p>Food and travel is a particularly compelling type of food blogging because it involves the engagement of different cultures. These bloggers travel around the globe, visiting and eating their way through cities known for food like Bangkok, Chengdu, and Tokyo, as well as lesser known hot food spots like Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, and Karachi, documenting their experience as they go. Food and travel blogging involves a lot of research, shooting, editing, investing & scheduling involved. These blog hosts bear the challenge of embracing other cultures and experiences, even if that means stepping out of their comfort zone.</p>
		<p>
		For many people, it's the visual appeal of food alone that draws their interest towards many food photographers/bloggers.Food photography is simply product photography with a focus on food. Food photographers aim to show, share, and persuade by photographing food arranged in a well lit, diligently arranged background. Unlike the other types of food blogging, food photographers have a specific mission to take the best possible photos and videos of food. Professional food photography is usually a collaborative process involving multiple people including a director, food and prop stylists, photographers, etc.</p>
